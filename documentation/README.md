For ```ID```, type ```ansible```

For ```Username```, type ```master```

NOTE: Replace ```master``` with your username which currently exists on the Master VM host.

For ```Private Key```, click ```Enter directly```

Run the following command in your Master VM:

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Click ```Key``` and copy the output from the previous command in the box given to you that says ```Enter New Secret Below```

Click ```OK```

NOTE: Never check sensitive material into source control!

### A. Modify hosts files: ###

Obtain the IP Address(es) of your Client VM(s). Add the IP Address(es) to both of the following hosts files:


- /etc/hosts
- /etc/ansible/hosts


![Screenshot](vm-hosts-file.png)

![Screenshot](vm-ansible-hosts-file.png)

NOTE: The Ansible hosts file is called the Inventory.

### B. Configure SSH: ###

Install openssh-server on Client VM:
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

Generate a new SSH Key and copy the public key to your Client VM:

    ssh-keygen
    ssh-copy-id client@client-client


NOTE: Replace ```client@client-client``` with your username and host. In the command above, the right-side of @ is the host, or IP Address. The left-side of @ is the username which currently exists on the host.

### C. Allow Passwordless Sudo: ###
Execute the following command in your Client VM in order to modify the ```sudoers``` file safely:

    sudo visudo

Add the following line at the bottom of the ```sudoers``` file:

Or use the provided ```playbook-install-kubernetes.yaml```. It requires you to run following command on your Master VM:

    ansible-playbook playbook-install-kubernetes.yaml

![Screenshot](ansible-install-kubernetes.png)


## 6. Make a Change to SCM

Modify the project however you like on ```SCM``` using ```git```.

NOTE: Master and Client VMs must be running. Also, Master VM must be running Jenkins with Poll SCM configured.

In your Master VM, open a new tab in a web-browser and open ```http://http://192.168.49.2:32500/``` to view the change when the pipeline is done.

NOTE: Replace ```192.168.49.2``` with your Client VM's IP Address. Replace ```32500``` with your application's service's nodePort.

## Useful Resources ##
